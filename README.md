cics-java-liberty-restapp-ext
=============================

This repository provides sample materials for use with the IBM Redbooks video course
"[Extending a CICS Web application using JCICS](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks.nsf/redbookabstracts/crse0302.html?Open)". The
application provided is a simple, RESTful web application providing several code examples for accessing CICS resources from Java using
the JCICS API.

This repository builds on the application constructed in the IBM Redbooks video course
"[Developing a RESTful Web application for Liberty in CICS](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks.nsf/redbookabstracts/crse0300.html?Open)",
which uses the [cics-java-liberty-restapp](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-restapp) repository.

For further examples, see the [cics-java-jcics-samples](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-jcics-samples) repository.
